### Team Members:
* Anupriya Sharma
* Mansi Jaiswal
* Ritu Malpani

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to draw meaningful insights from the data and find the possible reasons leading to customer churn from the bank. We wish to develop a classification model which predicts whether a customer will leave the bank or not on the basis of the several explanatory variables given in the dataset.

### Tool:
Python will be used as the programming language.

### Technique:
Since the problem is a classification one, we will train a Logistic Regression model on the data and make predictions.

### Dataset:
The dataset has been collected from Kaggle.

### Data Description:
* RowNumber — corresponds to the record (row) number
* CustomerId — contains random values
* Surname — the surname of a customer
* CreditScore — the credit score of an individual
* Geography — a customer’s location
* Gender — Male/Female
* Age — age of the customer
* Tenure — refers to the number of years that the customer has been a client of the bank
* Balance — account balance 
* NumOfProducts — refers to the number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.
* HasCrCard — denotes whether or not a customer has a credit card
* IsActiveMember — whether the customer is active or not (0/1)
* EstimatedSalary — salaries of the customers
* Exited — whether or not the customer left the bank
